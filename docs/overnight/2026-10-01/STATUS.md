# 2026-10-01 Overnight Status

Driver: `tpw-night-driver`. Source of phase scope: [accepted overnight plan](../../OVERNIGHT-WORKFLOW-PLAN-2026-10-01.md); frozen responsibility input: `docs/RESPONSIBILITY-BACKBONE.md` at `a77c3974128cee6059b1662579e3803fc1bdfcb9`.

## Baseline and M0

- Candidate branch: `night/2026-10-01-workflow`; current tip `fc746d81db43b58515e7ecba078884a05a472c12`, parent `496b0676e302e2d0eafba129ff61de4c203d258a` (the plan's fixed start). Initial candidate worktree was clean.
- Backbone file SHA-256: `ce82a70016a4a3fc234ea287f39aac8d79a260ddf13747c4fb705bda580453ba`.
- New product root: `professional-workflow/`; this directory owns the new package only. Process evidence and decisions live in this directory.
- Original worktree remains untouched by this Driver. It still has 8 staged paths and its existing tracked/untracked changes; preservation snapshot is `/private/tmp/tpw-legacy-preservation-20261001/` (manifest, index/worktree patches, untracked archive, HEAD and status captured there).
- Live runtime configurations observed: Oracle `codex gpt-6.1-sol / medium`; Driver `codex gpt-6-luna / xhigh`; `tpw-night-profile` and `tpw-night-source` are separate Pi sessions on `commandcode / deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash / max`. For both Pi sessions, session records contain `model_change`, `thinking_level_change: max`, and assistant message metadata with provider/model/thinkingLevel; this is runtime evidence, not argv inference.
- Herdr reports the workers in separate panes `w27:pE` and `w27:pF`, each with a distinct Pi session path. The profile worker may write `professional-workflow/profiles/` and `PROFILE-CANDIDATE.md`; the source worker may write only `SOURCE-SURVEY.md`. Driver remains the serial integrator for shared package files.

## Milestones

| Milestone | State | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | PASS | Git/input identity, preservation state, live Herdr identities and model/effort checked; see above and `DECISIONS.md`. |
| M1 | IN PROGRESS | Profile candidate and five-source read-only survey running in independent Flash sessions. Driver will evaluate dependencies and assign independent review on receipt. |
| M2 | IN PROGRESS | Driver drafting the short Charter and bounded assembly candidate against the frozen Backbone and M1 outputs. |
| M3 | NOT STARTED | Fixture design will keep evaluator's expected findings separate from implementation input. |
| M4 | IN PROGRESS | Five-source identity/method survey underway; source scope is the three original `upstreams/` roots plus two cached `sources/articles/` files. |
| M5 | NOT STARTED | Depends on accepted M1–M4 objects and serial integration. |
| M6 | NOT STARTED | Depends on a fixed M5 candidate object. |

## Active assignments

| Instance | Model / effort | Write set | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tpw-night-profile` (`w27:pE`) | Pi / DeepSeek V4.1 Flash / max | `professional-workflow/profiles/`, `docs/overnight/2026-10-01/PROFILE-CANDIDATE.md` | Working |
| `tpw-night-source` (`w27:pF`) | Pi / DeepSeek V4.1 Flash / max | `docs/overnight/2026-10-01/SOURCE-SURVEY.md` | Working |
